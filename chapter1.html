            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A computer system is an integrated set of components that work together to perform computing tasks. It consists of both hardware and software that interact to execute instructions and process data efficiently.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Components of a Computer System</h2>
            <p>A computer system can be broadly divided into two main components: <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>Hardware refers to the physical components of the computer system. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The brain of the computer that performs instructions and calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Temporarily stores data and instructions needed by the CPU for quick access.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> These include hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives to store data permanently.</li>
                <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Devices like keyboards, mice, and scanners that allow users to input data into the computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Devices such as monitors, printers, and speakers that allow users to receive the processed information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>Software refers to the programs and applications that run on the computer. There are two main types of software:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Software:</strong> The software that manages and controls the hardware, such as the operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).</li>
                <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs designed to perform specific tasks, such as word processors, web browsers, and games.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of Computers</h2>
            <p>Computers come in various types, each designed for specific purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Computers (PCs):</strong> These include desktops and laptops, designed for individual use.</li>
                <li><strong>Workstations:</strong> High-performance computers used for professional applications like graphic design, video editing, and software development.</li>
                <li><strong>Servers:</strong> Powerful computers used to manage network resources, store data, and support other computers in a network.</li>
                <li><strong>Supercomputers:</strong> Extremely powerful computers used for complex simulations and calculations, such as weather forecasting and scientific research.</li>
                <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Small, specialized computers integrated into devices like smartphones, microwaves, and automobiles.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Working of a Computer System</h2>
            <p>The working of a computer system can be summarized in the following stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> Data is entered into the computer system using input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse).</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The CPU processes the data by following a set of instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The data or results are stored in memory or storage devices for future use.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> The processed information is displayed on output devices like a monitor or printer.</li>
            </ol>
