        <h1>Chapter 5: Programming Concepts and Logics</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
            <p>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. These instructions are written in a programming language, and they form the foundation for all types of software applications. Understanding basic programming concepts and logic is crucial for anyone learning to program.</p>

            <h2>Key Programming Concepts</h2>

            <h3>1. Variables and Data Types</h3>
            <p>In programming, a variable is a container for storing data values. Each variable has a specific data type that defines the kind of data it holds, such as numbers, text, or boolean values. Common data types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integer (int):</strong> Represents whole numbers, e.g., 5, -10, 100.</li>
                <li><strong>Float:</strong> Represents decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 10.5.</li>
                <li><strong>String:</strong> Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello", "Computer Science".</li>
                <li><strong>Boolean (bool):</strong> Represents true or false values.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Operators</h3>
            <p>Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. There are several types of operators, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong> Used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> Used to compare values, such as equality (==), greater than (>), less than (<), etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> Used to combine or invert boolean values, such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Control Structures</h3>
            <p>Control structures determine the flow of execution in a program. Common control structures include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If-Else Statements:</strong> Used to make decisions based on conditions. For example:
                    <pre>
if (x > 10) {
    console.log("x is greater than 10");
} else {
    console.log("x is less than or equal to 10");
}
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Loops:</strong> Used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Common loops include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For Loop:</strong> Runs a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
                        <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> Runs a block of code as long as a condition is true.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Functions</h3>
            <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused throughout the program. Functions help organize and modularize code. Here's an example of a simple function:</p>
            <pre>
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
greet("John");  // Output: Hello, John
            </pre>
            <p>Functions can take parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs).</p>

            <h3>5. Arrays and Lists</h3>
            <p>Arrays (or lists) are used to store multiple values in a single variable. An array can hold elements of the same data type, and each element can be accessed by its index (position in the array). Here's an example of an array:</p>
            <pre>
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]);  // Output: Apple
            </pre>

            <h2>Logical Thinking in Programming</h2>
            <p>Programming logic involves thinking critically to break down a problem into smaller, manageable parts and developing an algorithm to solve it. Some key approaches to logical thinking in programming include:</p>

            <h3>1. Problem Decomposition</h3>
            <p>Decomposing a problem means breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. This makes complex problems easier to understand and solve.</p>

            <h3>2. Algorithm Design</h3>
            <p>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. Designing a good algorithm is crucial for writing efficient and effective code.</p>

            <h3>3. Debugging and Error Handling</h3>
            <p>Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in your code. Logical thinking plays a key role in finding and fixing bugs, as it involves systematically testing different parts of the program to identify the issue.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Programming is about solving problems and automating tasks using code. By mastering the fundamental concepts such as variables, operators, control structures, functions, and arrays, you can start developing your own software applications. Additionally, applying logical thinking and learning how to break down problems into smaller steps is essential to writing efficient and effective code. The more you practice, the better you will become at programming!</p>
